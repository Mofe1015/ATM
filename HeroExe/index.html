      <h2 class="gold">Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Wakanda's fearless protector, Black Panther, T'Challa, battles to
        safeguard his nation and the world. With his incredible strength and
        unparalleled intellect, he defends Wakanda's precious vibranium-rich
        lands from any threat that seeks to exploit their power. T'Challa's
        journey from a young prince to the powerful Black Panther is marked by
        trials, self-discovery, and unwavering determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born into the royal line of the Panther Tribe, T'Challa lost his father
        and predecessor, King T'Chaka, to a tragic event. This loss ignited his
        resolve to follow in his father's footsteps and embrace his destiny as
        both a leader and a fierce warrior. He has faced formidable foes like
        Killmonger and battled against global threats, always with the welfare
        of his people at heart.
